## User Experience: üëç

### Project Goals:
<p></p>

### Target Audience Goals:

* Browse various courses and be offered information about that course.
* Purchase products shown on the webstore.
* Create an account to track orders and purchase items on the webstore.
* A visually appealing and intuitive design.
* A website that is navigable on any device (mobile/tablet/desktop).
* Track orders made via profile dashboard.

### Site Owner Goals:

* Provide users with a safe and secure e-commerce platform in order to generate revenue from sales.
* Encourage user sales with promotions and discounts.
* Build awareness for the brand and attract new buyers.
* Collect user session data for market research purposes.

### User Stories:

<p>Jenny Says: "Ive been looking for a website for a while now that works just as well on my phone as it does my laptop, im far too busy to be sitting at my computer all day 
so I need a site that I can use just as well on my phone."</p>

<p>Tom Says: "Im often skeptical of buying online courses, I like to know that I have a line of communication with the company im paying with just incase there would be an issue
at some point down the line with the order."</p>

<p>Sarah Says: "Shopping on an e-commerce website has got to be easy, if you flood the user with too much choice you can cause them to panic and potentially leave the site and go elsewhere,
make it easy for the user to choose which items they want and buy them, simple!"</p>

### User Requirements and Expectations:
<p>When it comes to shopping on the web, users need to feel safe & comfortable in order for them to actually go through with purchases online, therefore providing the best UX, proper authentication
and using secure payment gateways (in this case Stripe) is necessary to offer the best solution.</p>

#### Requirements:

* Interact with a visually appealing and intuitive website.
* Navigate the website on any device, with ease.

* Add products to a shopping cart & update the cart quantities.
* Purchase products in the shopping cart in a safe and secure way.
* View orders in profile dashboard section.
* Can reach out to the business via email if needed.

#### Expectations:

* The Website will ensure safe storage of user details.
* The users payment information will not be stored in the website's database.
* The Website will load with sufficient speed.
* The Content on the website will be dynamic for any device.
* The Website will be navigable with ease.

## Design Choices: üé®
<p>I wanted the design of this website to reflect the modern feel of the minima but vivid coloursby using gray, balck and white and some other colour</p>

### Fonts:

<p>I chose to use Roboto as the main font family for this website as it provides an elegant & clean style for text and titles. In the essence of keeping the layout clean to encourage user sales, I decided to go with this font.</p>

### Icons:

<p>Thanks to the excellent collection of icons over at uniicons, selecting icons to use for was really simple, I decided to go with typical icons for the  navbar, the cart, the user icon and the burger button, as well as using various other intutitive icons across the project. I use icons in place of link text across the site where possible to provide the best UX possible to the user.</p>

### Colours:
<p></p>

### Base Styles:


### Images:
<p>The banner image used on the website main banner have been sourced from royalty free image website <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/2FPjlAyMQTA">here</a>. The images are related to learning and it helps to provide lifestyle imagery to the user and potentially entice them into making a purchase.</p>

## Wireframes/Flowcharts: üîß
<p>I used Balsamiq</a> to develop the wireframes forthe website, this seemless tool allowed me to easily make a wireframe for each page aswell as a wireframe for each device. I could then easily export them via the tool to .png files in order to save to the project.</p> 

<p>The wireframes for this project can be seen <a href="https://github.com/patrycja-io/ilearn-milestone/tree/master/wireframes">here</a></p>


### Database Design:

* During development oI worked with the standard <strong>sqlite3</strong> database that comes installed with Django.
* In the production version othe database is a <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> database, hosted and provided by Heroku.

### Data Models:

The user model used in this project is that which is provided by Django, click <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/contrib/auth/">here</a> to read more about those tables.

Read more about the sendgrid integration in the planning & testing section below.</p>
* <p>Order confirmation emails to be sent to the customer upon placing an order.</p>

## Planning:  + Testing: ‚úèÔ∏è üîå

#### Planning: 

<p>Planning for this project was extremely important, using and utilising new technology, frameworks, APIs and other tools can often be a challenge if you lack the correct preperation, continue reading to find out how each feature of was planned, tested, and how the feature works within the scope of the website.</p>

<p>Using the wireframes I built using sketch I was able to quickly build a base layout for the website, utilising component files where possible in order to provide resuable code in multiple areas across the website, thanks to the templating language that comes as standard with Django, this was an easy task.</p>

## Bugs üêû

#### Bugs During Development: 

<p>Stripe Integration</p>

- <strong>Bug</strong> : During development of the stripe integration I had ran into an issue in which I could not get the website to process the order using a test card, in debugging mode I was being told that the 'stripe_id' is required to perform a purchase.
 
- <strong>Fix</strong> : The fix for this bug was irritatingly simple, because the Stripe JS code relies on the jQuery library I had to reorder the order in which I import the scripts in scripts.html so that jQuery was rendered before the stripe.js file.

- <strong>Verdict</strong> : The bug was squashed and orders could now be processed!

#### Bugs in final Release:

<strong>Bug</strong> Remove option in basket
